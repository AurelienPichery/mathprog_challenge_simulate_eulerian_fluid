Eulerian Simulation of a Fluid

First project and first step on CFD. This code is a modificated and simplified version of this code (with some bugs fixed on gravity behavior):

## How to run
Just download the files and run a debug on the html file using visual studio code community.

## How does it works
The HTML file is just charged to load the main components of the GUI, and the CSS as usual set some important styles on those.
The JavaScript contains all the events for interaction as all of the functions to simulate the fluid.
